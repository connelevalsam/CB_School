# CB_School is a simple University Staff management application built using Golang(Go) + Postgresql(database) + Tachyons(CSS).

It is to help the School Admin to:
  1. See the distribution of staff arranged by rank in every unit of the university(programme, dept and faculty).
  2. Carry out transfer of staff
  3. Carry out promotion of staff
  4. Carry out removal of staff
  5. Carry out addition of staff
  6. Answer simple queries, e.g, display professors in faculty of Arts by dept, etc.
  

This is how far I've done for now.
Don't have a lot of time to finish yet but If i do...
You can send me a mail for the complete codes or tweet me.
I am not expensive ;)
